- **Validation:** SHA-256 hash comparison against hardcoded keys
- **Audit Trail:** All validation attempts logged
- **Blockchain:** Key usage recorded on immutable blockchain
- **Monitoring:** Audit function verifies single-use enforcement

### Session Management ✅
- **Session IDs:** SHA-256 hashed with UUID and timestamp
- **Timeout:** 24 hours (configurable)

- **Secure Storage:** Local file storage, not in cookies
- **Expiration:** Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

### Input Validation ✅
- **Email:** Format and domain verification
