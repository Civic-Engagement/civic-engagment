    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>It's NOT Traditional Government:</strong> Our Contract Governance system is completely separate from traditional government. These are platform governance roles that manage how our digital democracy system operates, makes decisions, and serves its community members.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Level 1: City Contract Elections - Where Democracy Begins</h3>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Representation Formula:</strong><br>
        • Base Representation: 2 Contract Senators + 2 Contract Representatives<br>
        • Population Scaling: +1 Representative per 100,000 people (above 200,000 threshold)<br>
        • Election Triggers: 1% population joins (initial) / 50% population (ongoing)
    </div>

            <div class="stat-label">People per Additional Rep</div>

    <p><strong>Real Example: Springfield, Illinois (200,000 people)</strong></p>
    <div class="example-box">
        Contract Senators: 2<br>
        Contract Representatives: 2 (base) + 0 (under threshold) = 2<br>
        Total Representatives: 4<br>
        Election Trigger: 2,000 members (1%) / 100,000 members (50%)
    </div>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Level 2: State Contract Elections - Regional Voice Amplification</h3>

    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Representation Formula:</strong><br>
        • Base Representation: 2 Contract Senators + 2 Contract Representatives<br>
        • Population Scaling: +1 Representative per 500,000 people<br>
        • Election Method: Electoral college system (cities vote for state candidates)
    </div>

    <p><strong>Real Example: Illinois (12.6 million people)</strong></p>
    <div class="example-box">
        Contract Senators: 2<br>
        Contract Representatives: 2 (base) + 25 (12.6M ÷ 500K) = 27<br>
        Total Representatives: 29<br>
        Electoral Process: Cities cast votes based on population
    </div>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Level 3: Country Contract Elections - National Democratic Leadership</h3>

    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Representation Formula:</strong><br>
        • Base Representation: 2 Contract Senators + 2 Contract Representatives<br>
        • Population Scaling: +1 Representative per 1,000,000 people<br>
        • Election Method: Electoral college system (states vote for country candidates)
    </div>

    <p><strong>Real Example: United States (330 million people)</strong></p>
    <div class="example-box">
        Contract Senators: 2<br>
        Contract Representatives: 2 (base) + 330 (330M ÷ 1M) = 332<br>
        Total Representatives: 334<br>
        Electoral Process: States cast votes based on representation
    </div>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Level 4: World Contract Elections - Global Democratic Governance</h3>

        • Population Scaling: +1 Representative per 4,000,000 people<br>
        • Election Method: Electoral college system (countries vote for world candidates)
    </div>

    <p><strong>Real Example: Earth (8 billion people)</strong></p>
    <div class="example-box">
        Contract Senators: 2<br>

        <li><strong>Electoral College Protection:</strong> Prevents large population centers from dominating</li>
        <li><strong>Eligibility Requirements:</strong> Progressive experience requirements prevent inexperienced leadership</li>

    <h2 class="section-title" id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Q: How is this different from regular government?</h3>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> This is completely separate contract governance for our digital democracy platform. You maintain all regular citizenship rights while participating in this additional layer of democratic governance.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Q: What if I don't have political experience?</h3>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Perfect! Everyone starts at the city level where no experience is required. Our system is designed to develop democratic leaders through progressive experience.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Q: How much time does participation require?</h3>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Q: Is my vote really secure and private?</h3>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! We use bank-level cryptographic security. Your vote is recorded securely but your identity remains private.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">Q: What prevents corruption and abuse of power?</h3>
