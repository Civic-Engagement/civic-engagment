  - NFC and QR code for quick sharing and verification
  - User photo
  - Name
  - Address
  - Public key or profile link
  - Designed for networking, civic events, and public identification

- **Private ID Card**: Used for secure account recovery and identity verification. Contains:
  - Private recovery QR code or NFC tag
  - User photo
  - Name
  - Address
  - Private recovery credentials (never shared)
  - Intended for personal use only; not to be given out

These cards enhance security, privacy, and convenience for users, supporting both public engagement and private account management.
# Civic Engagement Platform

## Mission Statement
Empower communities to participate in transparent, secure, and democratic governance through a decentralized, contract-based digital platform. Our goal is to prevent tyranny, protect minority rights, and ensure every citizen has a voice in decision-making.

## Why This Project Exists
Modern governance systems often suffer from lack of transparency, concentration of power, and limited citizen participation. This platform leverages blockchain, cryptography, and contract-based roles to:
- Prevent majority or minority tyranny
- Guarantee constitutional rights and due process
- Provide immutable audit trails for all actions
- Enable direct, secure, and fair participation for all users

## Who Is This For?
- **Citizens**: Anyone seeking a voice in local, state, or national governance
- **Representatives/Senators/Elders/Founders**: Elected or appointed officials with defined powers and checks
- **Moderators**: Community members responsible for content review and platform integrity
- **Developers**: Contributors building civic technology for transparency and democracy
- **Organizations**: Civic groups, educational institutions, pilot programs

## What Does It Do?
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure onboarding with identity verification, password hashing, and RSA key generation
- **Contract-Based Governance**: Multi-branch system (Citizens, Representatives, Senators, Elders, Founders) with checks and balances
- **Debate Platform**: Topic creation, argument threading, voting, and blockchain logging
- **Moderation System**: Flagging, review, warnings, and constitutional appeals
- **Blockchain Integration**: Hierarchical PoA blockchain for audit trails, validator registry, and P2P networking
- **Environment Separation**: Dev, test, and prod configs for safe development and deployment
- **UI**: PyQt5 desktop application with tabbed navigation for all modules

## Technical Architecture
- **Languages**: Python 3.x
- **Frameworks**: PyQt5 (GUI), custom blockchain, bcrypt, cryptography
- **Modules**: users, debates, moderation, blockchain, contracts, utils, tests
- **Data Storage**: JSON files per environment, blockchain for audit
- **Config**: ENV_CONFIG loaded from `main.py`, with paths set in `config/dev_config.json`, `config/test_config.json`, `config/prod_config.json`
- **Security**: bcrypt password hashing, RSA-2048 keys, input validation, local private key storage

## How It Works
1. **Startup**: Loads environment config, initializes UI and blockchain timer
2. **Registration/Login**: Validates user, generates keys, saves to database, records on blockchain
3. **Governance**: Assigns roles, enables elections, enforces contract-based permissions
4. **Debates**: Allows topic creation, argument submission, voting, and blockchain logging
5. **Moderation**: Enables flagging, review, warnings, and appeals with full audit trail
6. **Blockchain**: Records all actions, supports validator registry, and P2P foundation

## Development & Deployment
- **Setup**:
  ```bash
  cd civic_engagement_platform/civic_desktop
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python main.py
  ```
- **Environment Switching**: Change config path in `main.py` or use `reload_config()` in `main_window.py`
- **Testing**: Use separate test databases and requirements files
- **Extensibility**: Modular design for easy feature addition

## Governance Model
- **Contract Founders**: Genesis authority, emergency powers, constitutional amendments
- **Contract Elders**: Veto power, judicial review, appointment authority
- **Contract Representatives**: Legislative initiative, budget, impeachment
- **Contract Senators**: Legislative review, confirmation, override powers
- **Contract Citizens**: Electoral authority, initiative, recall, participation
- **Checks & Balances**: Multi-layered system to prevent concentration of power

## Security & Privacy
- **Password Security**: bcrypt with salt
- **Cryptography**: RSA-2048 keys
- **Session Management**: Secure, automatic logout
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive checks
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable blockchain records

## Features Needed for Government Adoption

To make this platform attractive for government use, the following features and assurances should be added:

- **Official Identity Verification**: Integrate with government ID databases or third-party verification services. Support for digital signatures and eID.
- **Compliance & Legal Framework**: Meet local, state, and national data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). Add audit logs and exportable compliance reports. Support for FOIA/public records requests.
- **Scalability & Performance**: Support large-scale deployments (millions of users), cloud and on-premise options, load balancing, and high-availability.
- **Interoperability & Integration**: RESTful API for integration with government systems, SSO with official authentication providers, data import/export tools for legacy systems.
- **Accessibility & Inclusivity**: Full WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance, multi-language support, mobile and offline access.
- **Advanced Security**: End-to-end encryption, granular role-based access controls, security certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001).
- **Customizable Governance Models**: Configurable for different government structures, custom workflows for elections, referendums, and legislative processes.
