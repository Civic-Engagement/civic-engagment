## 💡 Why This System Works: The Science of Democracy

### 🎯 **Progressive Experience Building**
Our eligibility ladder ensures qualified leadership while maintaining democratic access:

```
City Level ➜ State Level ➜ Country Level ➜ World Level
(Anyone)    (City Exp.)    (State Exp.)    (Country Exp.)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Skill Development**: Leaders gain experience at each level
- **Proven Performance**: Track record required for advancement
- **Democratic Access**: Anyone can start their political career
- **Quality Control**: Experience requirements ensure competent leadership

### 📊 **Population-Responsive Scaling**
Our mathematical formulas ensure fair representation as populations grow:

**Scaling Factors:**
- City: 100K people per representative (above 200K threshold)
- State: 500K people per representative  
- Country: 1M people per representative
- World: 4M people per representative

**Why These Numbers:**
- **Local Focus**: Smaller ratios for more intimate local representation
- **Regional Efficiency**: Moderate scaling for effective state governance
- **National Balance**: Large enough for efficiency, small enough for accountability
- **Global Practicality**: Manageable world representation while remaining inclusive

### ⚖️ **Electoral College Protection**
Our electoral college system prevents tyranny of large population centers:

**How It Works:**
- **City Elections**: Direct democracy (all citizens vote)
- **State Elections**: Cities vote based on their representation
- **Country Elections**: States vote based on their representation  
- **World Elections**: Countries vote based on their representation

**Democratic Benefits:**
- **Geographic Balance**: Rural and urban areas get fair representation
- **Cultural Protection**: Diverse communities maintain their voice
- **Coalition Building**: Candidates must appeal across regions
- **Minority Rights**: Prevents large cities from dominating rural areas
