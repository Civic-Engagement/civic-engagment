## 💡 Why This System Works: The Science of Democracy

### 🎯 **Progressive Experience Building**
Our eligibility ladder ensures qualified leadership while maintaining democratic access:

```
City Level ➜ State Level ➜ Country Level ➜ World Level
(Anyone)    (City Exp.)    (State Exp.)    (Country Exp.)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Skill Development**: Leaders gain experience at each level
- **Proven Performance**: Track record required for advancement

### 📊 **Population-Responsive Scaling**
