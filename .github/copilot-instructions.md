## Development Patterns & Best Practices

### 🎯 Module Integration Patterns
1. **Environment-Aware Data Access**:
   ```python
   # All modules use ENV_CONFIG for environment-specific paths
   from civic_desktop.main import ENV_CONFIG
   db_path = ENV_CONFIG.get('db_path', 'users/users_db.json')
   ```

2. **Cross-Module Communication**:
   ```python
   # Example: User action triggers blockchain record
   from civic_desktop.blockchain.blockchain import Blockchain
   from civic_desktop.users.session import SessionManager
   
   user = SessionManager.get_current_user()
   Blockchain.add_page(action_type="debate_vote", data=vote_data, user_email=user['email'])
   ```

3. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   ```python
   # Example: Check moderation permissions
   from civic_desktop.moderation.backend import ModerationBackend
   
   if ModerationBackend.can_moderate(user['email']):
       # Show moderation interface
   ```

4. **Data Validation Pattern**:
   ```python
   # Example: Validate user input
   from civic_desktop.utils.validation import DataValidator
   
   is_valid, message = DataValidator.validate_email(email)
   if not is_valid:
       QMessageBox.warning(self, "Invalid Email", message)
   ```

### 🛠️ Development Workflow
1. **Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd civic_desktop
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Environment Switching**:
   ```bash
   # Use environment variable
   set CIVIC_CONFIG=config/test_config.json
   python main.py
   
   # Or modify main.py CONFIG_PATH directly
   ```

3. **Testing**: Comprehensive pytest test suite in `tests/` directory
   ```bash
   cd civic_desktop
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. **Debugging**: Use PyQt5 debugging tools and console output

### 📊 Performance Considerations
- **Memory**: JSON files loaded on-demand, not cached
- **Storage**: Hierarchical blockchain prevents unlimited growth
- **UI**: Lazy loading for large lists and complex views
- **Network**: P2P connections managed asynchronously

## Contract-Based Governance System & Checks & Balances

### 🏛️ Constitutional Framework
The platform operates under a **Contract-Based Governance System** designed to prevent concentration of power and protect against both majority tyranny and minority dominance through multiple overlapping checks and balances.

### 📜 Contract Roles & Hierarchical Authority

#### 1. **Contract Founders** (Genesis Authority)
- **Role**: Original platform architects with constitutional authority
- **Powers**: 
  - Can modify core governance contracts only through supermajority consensus (75%+ of all Contract Founders)
  - Emergency protocol override during platform-threatening situations
  - Appointment of initial Contract Elders (transition power only)
- **Limitations**: 
  - Cannot directly govern day-to-day operations
  - Cannot override elected body decisions except in constitutional emergencies
  - Subject to removal by 2/3 vote of Contract Elders + Contract Senators combined
- **Term**: Lifetime appointment with removal provisions
- **Selection**: Hardcoded in genesis block, maximum 7 founders

#### 2. **Contract Elders** (Wisdom Council)
- **Role**: Experienced advisors with veto power and constitutional interpretation
- **Powers**:
  - **Constitutional Veto**: Can block any proposal that violates platform principles (requires 60% of Elders)
  - **Judicial Review**: Interpret governance contracts and resolve disputes
  - **Elder Veto**: Can override decisions by Representatives/Senators if deemed harmful to platform (requires 75% of Elders)
  - **Appointment Authority**: Nominate candidates for critical platform positions
- **Limitations**:
  - Cannot initiate legislation or policy
  - Cannot directly govern without other branch approval
  - Subject to recall by citizens through special referendum (requires 55% voter turnout + 60% approval)
- **Term**: 4 years, renewable, maximum 3 consecutive terms
- **Selection**: Elected by all Contract Representatives and Contract Senators combined (requires 55% approval)

#### 3. **Contract Representatives** (House of the People)
- **Role**: Direct representatives of citizen interests with legislative power
- **Powers**:
  - **Legislative Initiative**: Create and propose new platform policies and regulations
  - **Budget Authority**: Control platform resource allocation and spending
  - **Impeachment Power**: Can impeach Contract Senators, Elders, or Founders (requires 60% vote)
  - **Platform Oversight**: Monitor and investigate platform operations
- **Limitations**:
  - All proposals subject to Contract Elder veto review
  - Cannot override Contract Elder constitutional interpretations
  - Decisions require bicameral approval from Contract Senators
- **Term**: 2 years, unlimited terms
- **Selection**: Direct election by citizens within geographic jurisdiction

#### 4. **Contract Senators** (Deliberative Upper House)
- **Role**: Thoughtful deliberation and check on Representative populism
- **Powers**:
  - **Legislative Review**: Must approve all Representative proposals before implementation
  - **Deliberative Delay**: Can require 30-day cooling-off period for major decisions
  - **Confirmation Authority**: Approve major appointments and platform changes
  - **Override Power**: Can override Contract Elder vetoes with 67% supermajority
- **Limitations**:
  - Cannot initiate spending or taxation proposals (must originate from Representatives)
  - Cannot override Contract Founder emergency powers
  - Subject to citizen recall with same threshold as Contract Elders
- **Term**: 6 years, maximum 2 consecutive terms
- **Selection**: Mixed system - 1/3 elected by Representatives, 1/3 by citizen vote, 1/3 by Contract Elders

#### 5. **Contract Citizens** (Sovereign Authority)
- **Role**: Ultimate source of democratic legitimacy with constitutional rights
- **Powers**:
  - **Electoral Authority**: Vote in all elections and referendums
  - **Initiative Power**: Propose constitutional amendments (requires 40% petition + 55% approval)
  - **Recall Authority**: Remove any elected official through special elections
  - **Platform Participation**: Full debate, moderation, and governance participation
- **Protections**:
  - **Constitutional Rights**: Cannot be overridden by any single branch of government
  - **Minority Protection**: Geographic and demographic representation guarantees
  - **Due Process**: Appeals process for any moderation or governance decisions

### ⚖️ Multi-Layered Checks & Balances

#### **Preventing Majority Tyranny:**
1. **Geographic Representation**: Electoral college system ensures small cities/states have voice
2. **Supermajority Requirements**: Major changes require 60-75% approval, not simple majority
3. **Constitutional Rights**: Fundamental citizen rights cannot be voted away
4. **Contract Elder Veto**: Wisdom council can block majority decisions that violate principles
5. **Bicameral Legislature**: Representatives + Senators must both approve major changes
6. **Staggered Terms**: Different election cycles prevent sudden complete power shifts

#### **Preventing Minority Rule:**
1. **Popular Mandate**: Contract Representatives directly elected by citizen majority
2. **Override Powers**: Contract Senators can override Elder vetoes with supermajority
3. **Recall Mechanisms**: Citizens can remove any official through special elections
4. **Initiative Process**: Citizens can bypass government gridlock through direct proposals
5. **Regular Elections**: No permanent appointment except Contract Founders (with removal clause)
6. **Transparency Requirements**: All decisions recorded on blockchain for public accountability

#### **Preventing Single-Point-of-Failure:**
1. **Distributed Authority**: No single role can make unilateral decisions
2. **Cross-Branch Approval**: Major changes require multiple branch consensus
3. **Redundant Oversight**: Multiple bodies can investigate and impeach others
4. **Constitutional Limits**: Even Contract Founders bound by governance contracts
5. **Democratic Succession**: Clear procedures for replacing officials at all levels
6. **Blockchain Enforcement**: Technical prevention of unauthorized governance changes

### 🔄 Decision-Making Processes

#### **Regular Governance** (Most Decisions):
```
1. Contract Representatives propose legislation
2. Contract Senators review and deliberate (30-day period for major changes)
3. Contract Elders review for constitutional compliance
4. If no Elder veto → Implementation
5. If Elder veto → Return to Senators for potential override vote
```

#### **Constitutional Changes** (Platform Fundamentals):
```
1. Contract Founders (75%+ consensus) OR Citizen Initiative (40% petition)
2. Contract Representatives approval (60%+ vote)
3. Contract Senators approval (60%+ vote)
4. Contract Elders constitutional review
5. Citizen ratification (55%+ turnout, 60%+ approval)
6. 6-month implementation period with review process
```

#### **Emergency Protocols** (Platform-Threatening Situations):
```
1. Contract Founders emergency declaration (75%+ consensus)
2. 48-hour implementation period
3. Contract Elders immediate review
4. Contract Senators emergency session within 7 days
5. Citizen referendum within 30 days to confirm/overturn
```

#### **Conflict Resolution** (Branch Disagreements):
```
1. Contract Elders mediation attempt
2. Special joint session of Representatives + Senators
3. If unresolved → Citizen referendum with 30-day debate period
4. Binding resolution with 55%+ turnout threshold
```

### 🗳️ Electoral Safeguards

#### **Proportional Geographic Representation**:
- **City Level**: Direct democracy with ranked-choice voting
- **State Level**: Mixed proportional + geographic representation
- **Federal Level**: Bicameral system preventing large-state dominance

#### **Anti-Corruption Measures**:
- **Term Limits**: Prevent entrenched power structures
- **Public Funding**: Platform-provided resources for campaigns
- **Transparency Requirements**: All donations and decisions on blockchain
- **Conflict of Interest**: Mandatory disclosure and recusal procedures

#### **Inclusive Participation**:
- **Accessibility Requirements**: Platform must accommodate all users
- **Language Support**: Multi-language support for diverse communities
- **Digital Divide**: Offline participation options for non-technical users
- **Equal Time**: Guaranteed platform access for all candidates and viewpoints

### 🛡️ Rights & Protections Framework

#### **Fundamental Citizen Rights** (Cannot be overridden):
1. **Free Expression**: Right to speak, debate, and criticize governance
2. **Due Process**: Fair treatment in all moderation and governance procedures  
3. **Equal Participation**: Equal access to platform features and democratic processes
4. **Privacy Protection**: Personal data security and limited government surveillance
5. **Appeal Rights**: Ability to challenge any governance or moderation decision

#### **Minority Protection Mechanisms**:
1. **Geographic Quotas**: Guaranteed representation for smaller jurisdictions
2. **Demographic Safeguards**: Anti-discrimination enforcement in elections and governance
3. **Cultural Preservation**: Protection for diverse viewpoints and communities
4. **Religious Freedom**: Secular governance with protection for all beliefs
5. **Economic Fairness**: Prevention of wealth-based political discrimination

This governance structure creates a robust system of overlapping checks and balances that prevents any single person, group, majority, or minority from dominating the platform while ensuring democratic legitimacy and citizen sovereignty.

## Critical AI Agent Knowledge

### 🚨 Essential Integration Points
1. **Environment Configuration**: All modules use `ENV_CONFIG` from `main.py` - never hardcode paths
2. **Tab-Based Architecture**: Main window has 18 tabs - Users, Debates, Moderation, Blockchain, Contracts, Training, Crypto/Wallet, GitHub, P2P, Maps, Reports, Analytics, Events, Communications, Surveys, Petitions, Documents, Transparency, Collaboration
3. **Session Management**: `SessionManager.get_current_user()` and `SessionManager.is_authenticated()` used throughout
4. **Blockchain Recording**: All significant actions recorded via `Blockchain.add_page(action_type, data, user_email)`
5. **Role-Based Access**: Use module-specific `can_*()` functions before UI/action access

### ⚡ Key Workflow Commands

### Flagging Content (Any User Action)
```python
# In moderation/backend.py  
def flag_content(content_type, content_id, reason, reporter_email, severity="medium"):
    # 1. Validate input
    if not DataValidator.validate_email(reporter_email)[0]:
        return False, "Invalid reporter email"
    
    # 2. Create flag record
    flag_data = {
        'id': generate_id(),
        'content_type': content_type,
        'content_id': content_id,
        'reason': reason,
        'reporter_email': reporter_email,
        'severity': severity,
        'status': 'pending',
        'created_at': datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    
    # 3. Store flag and blockchain record
    flags = load_flags()
    flags.append(flag_data)
    save_flags(flags)
    
    # 4. Blockchain audit trail
    Blockchain.add_page(
        action_type="content_flagged",
        data=flag_data,
        user_email=reporter_email
    )
    
    return True, "Content flagged for review"
