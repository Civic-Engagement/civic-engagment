MASTER FINGERPRINT: x9y8z7w6v5u4t3s2r1q0p9o8n7m6l5k4

CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY:
- Modify core governance contracts (75%+ consensus)
- Emergency protocol override (platform threats)  
- Initial Elder appointment (transition only)
- Platform architecture changes

CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS:
- Cannot directly govern day-to-day operations
- Cannot override elected body decisions (except emergencies)
- Subject to Elder + Senator removal (2/3 vote)
- Supermajority consensus required for major actions

CRITICAL SECURITY INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Keep this private key absolutely secure and confidential
2. This key grants maximum constitutional authority on the platform
3. Loss of this key means permanent loss of Founder status
4. Create secure offline backups in multiple locations
5. Never share this key or store it in unsecured locations

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. During account registration on the Civic Engagement Platform
2. Provide this ENTIRE private key text in the "Founder Private Key" field
3. Your account will be automatically assigned Founder constitutional authority
4. Delete this file after successful registration and backup

PRIVATE KEY (PEM FORMAT):
