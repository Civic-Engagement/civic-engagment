```

### Vote on Amendment

```python
from contracts.amendment_system import VoteOption

success, message = amendment_manager.vote_on_amendment(

    voter_email='representative@springfield.gov',
    vote=VoteOption.APPROVE,
    reasoning='Enhances citizen participation'
)
```

### Constitutional Review

```python
from contracts.amendment_system import ConstitutionalEnforcement

enforcement = ConstitutionalEnforcement()

success, review_data = enforcement.review_constitutional_compliance(

    elder_email='elder@civic.gov'
)
```

### Generate from Template

```python
from contracts.genesis_contract import generate_contract_from_template
