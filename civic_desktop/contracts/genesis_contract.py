PREAMBLE

We, the Founders and Citizens of this commonwealth, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense of our shared values, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Genesis Contract for this Platform.

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. To secure these, and other rights inherent to a just society, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Within this domain, these rights manifest as Expression, Privacy, Property, and the Pursuit of Governance.
