- **Permission matrix**: `CITIZEN_PERMISSIONS` → `MEMBER_PERMISSIONS`
- **Governance structure**: All references updated to use member terminology

#### **✅ Test Suite Updates:**
- **All test files** updated to use `contract_member` instead of `contract_citizen`
- **Integration tests** updated with new role assignments
- **Demo files** use new member terminology

## 🌐 **NEW MULTI-LEVEL BLOCKCHAIN VALIDATION SYSTEM**

### **🎯 System Purpose**

Contract Members can now validate and sign blockchain transactions through multiple geographic and role-based validation levels:

1. **👤 Founder Validation** - Constitutional authority validation by Contract Founders
2. **🏙️ City Validation** - Local member validation (33% of city members required)
3. **🏛️ State Validation** - State-level validation (25% of state members required) 
4. **🌍 Country Validation** - National validation (20% of country members required)
5. **⚖️ Role Validation** - Position-based validation by government officials

### **🔧 Implementation Details**

#### **New File: `blockchain/multi_level_validation.py`**

**Key Classes:**
- **`MultiLevelValidator`**: Main validation system coordinator
- **`ValidationType`**: Enum for different validation methods
- **`ValidationLevel`**: Security levels (Basic, Standard, Secure, Maximum)

**Core Features:**
```python
# Register Contract Member as validator
register_member_as_validator(user_email, user_data)

# Create validation request for blockchain block
create_block_validation_request(block_hash, validation_level, requester_email, block_data)

# Submit member validation
submit_validation(request_id, validator_email, validation_type, approve, signature)

# Check validation status
get_validation_request_status(request_id)
```

#### **Validation Thresholds by Jurisdiction:**

| **Level** | **Min Validators** | **% Required** | **Timeout** |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **City** | 3 | 33% | 24 hours |
| **State** | 5 | 25% | 48 hours |
| **Country** | 10 | 20% | 72 hours |
| **Founder** | 1 | 10% | 12 hours |

### **🚀 Validation Security Levels**

#### **🔹 Basic Level**
- **City validation only** 
- **Use case**: Local community decisions, routine transactions

#### **🔹 Standard Level**
- **City + State validation**
- **Use case**: Regional governance, state-level policy changes

#### **🔹 Secure Level** 
- **City + State + Country validation**
- **Use case**: National governance, constitutional amendments

#### **🔹 Maximum Level**
- **All validation types required** (Founder + City + State + Country + Role)
- **Use case**: Constitutional changes, emergency protocols

## 🏗️ **INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING BLOCKCHAIN**

### **✅ Updated Blockchain Validator Registration**

**Previous restriction**: Only elected representatives could be validators
```python
# OLD CODE
if role not in ['contract_representative', 'contract_senator', 'contract_elder', 'contract_founder']:
    return False, "Only elected representatives can serve as validators"
```

**New inclusion**: Contract Members can now validate
```python
# NEW CODE  
if role not in ['contract_member', 'contract_representative', 'contract_senator', 'contract_elder', 'contract_founder']:
    return False, "Contract Members and elected representatives can serve as validators"
```

### **✅ Automatic Multi-Level Registration**

When users register as blockchain validators, they're automatically enrolled in the multi-level validation system:

```python
# Registers with both traditional blockchain validation AND multi-level system
validator_success = blockchain.register_validator(user_email, public_key, role)
```

## 🎮 **USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS**

### **🔹 For Contract Members:**

1. **Enhanced Democratic Participation**:
   - Can now validate blockchain transactions
   - Multiple validation pathways available
   - Geographic representation in consensus

2. **Transparent Validation Process**:
   - Real-time validation status tracking
   - Clear progress indicators for each validation type
   - Geographic validation requirements clearly displayed

3. **Flexible Participation**:
   - Choose validation types based on jurisdiction
   - Optional participation - no mandatory validation requirements
   - Rewards system integration for validation participation

### **🔹 For Government Officials:**

1. **Maintained Authority**:
   - Representatives, Senators, Elders, and Founders retain all existing validation rights
   - Additional oversight capabilities through multi-level system
   - Constitutional review powers preserved

2. **Enhanced Oversight**:
   - Can participate in geographic validation
   - Monitor member participation rates
   - Review validation consensus patterns

## 📊 **VALIDATION WORKFLOW EXAMPLE**

### **Scenario: State-Level Policy Change**

1. **📝 Request Creation**:
   ```python
   request_id = create_block_validation_request(
       block_hash="policy_block_123",
       validation_level=ValidationLevel.STANDARD,  # City + State
       requester_email="policy.author@state.gov",
       block_data=policy_change_data
   )
   ```

2. **🏙️ City Validation** (33% of city members required):
   - 3 minimum validators needed
   - Members from same city as requester can validate
   - Real-time progress: "2/3 city validations received"

3. **🏛️ State Validation** (25% of state members required):
   - 5 minimum validators needed  
   - Members from same state as requester can validate
   - Progress: "3/5 state validations received"

4. **✅ Consensus Reached**:
   - Both city and state validation thresholds met
   - Majority approval (>51%) achieved
   - Block automatically approved and signed
   - Validation complete - policy change recorded on blockchain
