## 🛡️ **SECURITY STATUS**

### **✅ Protection Status:**
- **73 sensitive files** properly protected by .gitignore
- **All private keys** (.pem files) ignored and secure
- **All user databases** protected from public access
- **Distribution packages** properly secured

### **📋 Tracked Files Status:**
The security validator found some "potentially sensitive" tracked files, but these are actually **safe to track**:

#### **✅ Safe Code Files:**
- `founder_keys.py` - Contains code logic, no sensitive data
- `keys.py` - RSA key generation utilities, no private keys
- `hardcoded_founder_keys.py` - Contains only SHA-256 hashes, not private keys

#### **✅ Safe Configuration Files:**
- `*_info.json` - Contains metadata and fingerprints, no private keys
- `founder_keys_master.json` - Distribution tracking, no sensitive data
- `used_founder_keys.json` - Usage tracking, no private keys

#### **✅ Safe Documentation:**
- `FOUNDER_KEY_SYSTEM.md` - Documentation files
- `setup_founder_keys.py` - Setup scripts (now in scripts/)

**🔒 All actual private keys (.pem files) are properly protected and never tracked.**
