## 🎯 Key Features

### Contract Role Formatting
```python
# City Contract Roles
city_candidate.get_formatted_title("Springfield", "Illinois")
# Returns: "Contract Representative for Springfield, Illinois"
# Returns: "Contract Senator for Springfield, Illinois"

# State Contract Roles  
state_candidate.get_formatted_title("Illinois")
# Returns: "Contract Representative for Illinois"
# Returns: "Contract Senator for Illinois"
```

### Clear Distinction
- **Platform Governance**: Contract-based roles for civic engagement platform administration
- **Not Government**: These are NOT traditional government positions
- **Digital Democracy**: Roles manage platform features, debates, moderation, blockchain governance

## 📊 System Architecture

### City Contract Elections
- **Representation**: 2 Contract Senators + 2 Contract Representatives (base)
- **Scaling**: +1 Contract Representative per 100K population (cities >200K)
- **Triggers**: 1% population → first election, 50% → ongoing elections
- **Terms**: 1 year, max 4 terms, non-consecutive

### State Contract Elections  
- **Representation**: 2 Contract Senators + population-based Contract Representatives
- **Electoral College**: Cities vote for state candidates
- **Eligibility**: Must have been city contract representative/senator
- **Terms**: Same as city (1 year, max 4, non-consecutive)

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Blockchain Recording
All contract elections, candidacies, and governance actions are permanently recorded on the platform's blockchain for transparency and auditability.

### User Authentication  
Contract roles integrate with the platform's user authentication system and role-based permissions.

### Task Management
Election events trigger task notifications across the platform for user engagement.
