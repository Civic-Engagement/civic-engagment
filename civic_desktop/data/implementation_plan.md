```

### **Week 2: Data Validation & Integration**

#### Automated Data Quality Pipeline
```python
# Data Validation Framework:

1. Geographic Validation
   - Boundary polygon integrity
   - Coordinate system consistency  
   - Hierarchical relationship verification

2. Official Information Verification
   - Cross-reference multiple sources
   - Term limit and election cycle validation
   - Contact information accuracy verification

3. Completeness Assessment
   - Coverage gap identification
   - Missing data prioritization
   - Update frequency optimization
```
