```

### Run Demo
```bash
cd civic_desktop/maps
python demo_location_services.py  # Complete feature demonstration
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from maps.location_services import (
    initialize_geographic_services,
    register_civic_venue,
    define_jurisdictional_boundaries,
    coordinate_event_location
)

# Initialize services
config = {'enabled_services': ['jurisdictional_mapping', 'civic_venue_mapping']}
success, config_id = initialize_geographic_services('admin@civic.org', config)

# Register a venue
venue_data = {
    'name': 'City Hall',
    'category': 'town_hall',
    'location': {'address': '123 Main St', 'latitude': 37.77, 'longitude': -122.41},
    'capacity': {'maximum': 250},
    'accessibility': {'wheelchair_access': True},
    'equipment': {'av_system': True},
    'contact': {'primary_contact': 'Manager', 'phone': '555-1234', 'email': 'contact@city.gov'}
}
success, venue_id = register_civic_venue('manager@civic.org', venue_data)

# Define a boundary
boundary_data = {
    'jurisdiction_name': 'District 3',
    'jurisdiction_level': 'district',
    'boundary_coordinates': [[37.79, -122.42], [37.79, -122.40], [37.77, -122.40], [37.77, -122.42], [37.79, -122.42]],
    'population': 45000
}
success, boundary_id = define_jurisdictional_boundaries('admin@civic.org', boundary_data)

# Coordinate an event
event_request = {
    'event_name': 'Town Hall Meeting',
    'event_type': 'town_hall_meeting',
    'event_date': '2024-12-01T18:00:00',
    'jurisdiction': 'San Francisco, CA',
    'expected_attendance': 200
}
success, coordination_id = coordinate_event_location('coordinator@civic.org', event_request)
```
