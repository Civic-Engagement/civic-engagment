  • City Level: Local representatives and higher

Constitutional Review:
  • Only Contract Elders can perform constitutional reviews

  1. ContractTaskHandler.create_contract_review_tasks() is called

  3. Task type: TaskType.CONTRACT_REVIEW
  4. Review requirements specified:
     - Constitutional compliance check
     - Impact analysis review
     - Precedent review
     - Stakeholder analysis

Task Data Includes:
  • amendment_id: Unique amendment identifier
  • amendment_type: constitutional/legislative/procedural
  • amendment_text: Full amendment text
  • review_deadline: Calculated based on contract level
  • review_requirements: Checklist for reviewers

Task Completion:
  • Reviewers complete constitutional analysis
  • Results feed into approval workflow
  • Elder review tasks have highest priority
  • All reviews recorded on blockchain

Example: City Representative Proposes Amendment

Step 1: VALIDATION
  ✓ User module checks: Is user a City Representative?
  ✓ Contract module checks: Authority for this contract level?
  ✓ Blockchain query: Check user's governance history

Step 2: AMENDMENT PROPOSAL
  ✓ Create amendment record with impact analysis
  ✓ Schedule public comment period (14-30 days)
  ✓ Generate voting schedule based on contract level
  ✓ Record proposal on blockchain (action_type: amendment_proposed)

Step 3: TASK CREATION
  ✓ Identify eligible reviewers from user database
  ✓ Create CONTRACT_REVIEW tasks for each reviewer
  ✓ Set priority based on amendment importance
  ✓ Calculate review deadline

Step 4: CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW (if required)
  ✓ Elder receives CONTRACT_REVIEW task
  ✓ Performs comprehensive constitutional analysis:
    - Fundamental rights compliance
    - Separation of powers validation
    - Checks and balances verification
    - Minority protection assessment
    - Due process provisions
    - Constitutional precedent analysis
  ✓ Review recorded on blockchain (action_type: constitutional_review)

Step 5: VOTING PROCESS
  ✓ User module provides list of eligible voters by role
  ✓ Each vote validated for eligibility
  ✓ Double-voting prevention enforced
  ✓ All votes recorded on blockchain (action_type: amendment_voted)
  ✓ Real-time vote tallies updated

Step 6: APPROVAL CHECK
  ✓ Calculate approval percentages by branch
  ✓ Check against contract-specific requirements:
    - Master: 75% Founders + 60% Citizens
    - Country: 60% Bicameral + Elder + 55% Citizens
    - State: 60% Bicameral + Elder
    - City: 55% Representatives + 50% Citizens
  ✓ If approved: Status → APPROVED
  ✓ If rejected: Status → REJECTED

Step 7: IMPLEMENTATION (if approved)
  ✓ Update contract with amendment text
  ✓ Record in amendment_history
  ✓ Update hierarchical compliance for child contracts
  ✓ Notify all stakeholders via task system
  ✓ Final implementation recorded on blockchain (action_type: contract_amended)

Throughout Process:
  ✓ Blockchain: Immutable audit trail
  ✓ Users: Role-based permissions enforced
  ✓ Tasks: Automated workflow management
  ✓ Transparency: All actions publicly visible

Key Integration Points:
  1. Authority Validation: User roles determine contract permissions
  2. Blockchain Recording: All actions permanently recorded
  3. Task Automation: Review workflows managed by task system
  4. Constitutional Review: Elder oversight integrated
  5. Multi-Branch Voting: Cross-module coordination

Benefits:
  • Transparent governance at all levels
  • Role-based access control
  • Complete audit trail
  • Automated workflows
  • Constitutional safeguards

The hierarchical contract system is fully integrated and
operational within the Civic Engagement Platform!
