🏛️ CITY CONTRACT ELECTIONS:
   • Representation: 2 Contract Senators + 2+ Contract Representatives
   • Scaling: +1 Contract Rep per 100K population (cities >200K)
   • Triggers: 1% population → first election, 50% → ongoing
   • Format: "Contract Senator/Representative for CityName, StateName"

🗳️ STATE CONTRACT ELECTIONS:
   • Representation: 2 Contract Senators + population-based Contract Reps
   • Electoral College: Cities vote for state candidates
   • Eligibility: Must have been city contract rep/senator
   • Format: "Contract Senator/Representative for StateName"

🌍 COUNTRY CONTRACT ELECTIONS:
   • Representation: 2 Contract Senators + 1 Contract Rep per 1M people
   • Electoral College: States vote for country candidates  
   • Eligibility: Must have been state contract rep/senator
   • Format: "Contract Senator/Representative for CountryName"

🌎 WORLD CONTRACT ELECTIONS:
   • Representation: 2 Contract Senators + 1 Contract Rep per 4M people
   • Electoral College: Countries vote for world candidates
   • Eligibility: Must have been country contract rep/senator
   • Format: "Contract Senator/Representative for World"

📊 REPRESENTATION EXAMPLES:
   City (1M people):     4 Contract Reps (2+2), 2 Contract Senators
   State (50M people):   102 Contract Reps (2+100), 2 Contract Senators  
   Country (330M people): 332 Contract Reps (2+330), 2 Contract Senators
   World (8B people):    2,002 Contract Reps (2+2000), 2 Contract Senators

🔗 HIERARCHICAL ELECTORAL FLOW:
   Citizens → City Elections → State Elections → Country Elections → World Elections
       ↓           ↓              ↓               ↓                ↓
   Contract    Contract       Contract        Contract         Contract
   Citizens → City Reps → State Reps → Country Reps → World Reps

📱 USER INTERFACE:
   • PyQt5 desktop application with four governance tabs
   • 🏛️ City Contract Elections
   • 🗳️ State Contract Elections  
   • 🌍 Country Contract Elections
   • 🌎 World Contract Elections

⛓️ BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION:
   • All elections, candidates, and votes recorded on blockchain
   • Transparent audit trails at every governance level
   • Cryptographic verification of electoral integrity
   • Immutable democratic participation records

🔒 DEMOCRATIC SAFEGUARDS:
   • Population-based representation scaling
   • Term limits: 1 year, max 4 consecutive terms
   • Electoral college prevents direct population dominance  
   • Eligibility requirements ensure governance experience
   • Constitutional oversight at all levels

✅ STATUS: Complete four-tier contract governance system ready for deployment!
