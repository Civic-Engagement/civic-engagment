## 🏛️ How the Tasks Module Works

### **For Users (Contract Members)**
When you open the Civic Engagement Platform, the **Tasks tab is now your main dashboard** where you'll find:

- **🗳️ Validation Tasks**: When blockchain transactions need your approval
- **📊 Voting Opportunities**: Elections you're eligible to participate in  
- **📜 Contract Reviews**: Constitutional amendments requiring your input
- **⚖️ Moderation Duties**: Content flagged for community review
- **🎓 Training Requirements**: Civic education modules to complete

### **Automatic Task Assignment**
The system automatically creates tasks for you based on:
- Your contract role (Citizen, Representative, Senator, Elder, Founder)
- Your geographic jurisdiction (city, state, country)
- Blockchain events requiring validation or voting
- Training requirements for civic participation
- Moderation responsibilities for your expertise level

### **Task Lifecycle**
1. **Creation**: Tasks automatically appear based on civic events
2. **Notification**: You receive alerts through your preferred channels
3. **Action**: Complete tasks through intuitive interfaces
4. **Verification**: Your actions are recorded on the blockchain
5. **Rewards**: Earn CivicCoin (CVC) for responsible participation

## 🔄 Cross-Module Integration

The Tasks system seamlessly integrates with all existing modules:

- **👤 Users**: Role-based task assignment and authentication
- **🗳️ Debates**: Voting tasks for active topics
- **⚖️ Moderation**: Content review and appeal tasks
- **⛓️ Blockchain**: Validation tasks for transaction approval
- **📜 Contracts**: Amendment review and voting tasks
- **🎓 Training**: Educational completion requirements
- **💰 Crypto**: Reward distribution for task completion
- **📊 Analytics**: Task completion statistics and metrics

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Run the Application**
```powershell
cd civic_desktop
python main.py
```

The application will:
1. Initialize the task management system
2. Process any pending notifications
3. Create the main window with Tasks as the primary tab
4. Start monitoring for new civic duties automatically

### **Development Mode**
```powershell
$env:CIVIC_CONFIG = "config/dev_config.json"
python main.py
```

Development mode includes:
- Faster task creation and reminders
- Debug logging and test data
- Relaxed validation thresholds
- Extended notification limits
