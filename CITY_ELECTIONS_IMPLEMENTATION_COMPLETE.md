# City/Town Election System - Implementation Complete! üèõÔ∏è

## üéâ System Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive **City/Town Election System** for the Civic Engagement Platform that provides democratic governance at the municipal level with population-based triggers and term limits as specified.

## üìã Key Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ **Population-Based Election Triggers**
- **1% Threshold**: Initial election triggered when 1% of city population becomes members
- **50% Threshold**: Expansion election triggered when 50% of city population becomes members  
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Additional representative and senator positions created at expansion

### ‚úÖ **Term Limits and Restrictions**
- **Term Length**: 1 year per term
- **Maximum Terms**: 4 total terms per person per office
- **Consecutive Restriction**: Cannot serve consecutive terms (must wait 1 year between terms)
- **Eligibility Verification**: Automatic checking of term limit compliance

### ‚úÖ **Democratic Offices**
- **City Representative**: Municipal legislative authority  
- **City Senator**: Municipal deliberative oversight
- **Town Representative**: Same as city, for smaller communities
- **Town Senator**: Same as town senate, for smaller communities

### ‚úÖ **Election Process**
- **Candidate Registration**: Platform statements and eligibility verification
- **Campaign Period**: 30 days for candidate outreach
- **Voting Period**: 7 days for democratic participation  
- **Results Certification**: Transparent vote counting and announcement

## üóÇÔ∏è Files Created

### **1. Core Election System** (`governance/city_elections.py`)
- **CityElectionManager**: Main election management class
- **CityElectionConfig**: Configuration for city election parameters
- **CityElection**: Election instance management
- **CityCandidate**: Candidate registration and tracking
- **Population Tracking**: Member growth and threshold monitoring
- **Term Tracking**: Previous term history and eligibility checking

### **2. User Interface** (`governance/city_election_ui.py`) 
- **CityElectionWidget**: Main election management interface
- **CityRegistrationDialog**: New city registration form
- **CandidateRegistrationDialog**: Candidate application form
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Election analytics and reporting
- **City Management**: Member tracking and election scheduling

### **3. Integration** (Updated files)
- **Contract Roles** (`users/contract_roles.py`): Added city/town roles
- **Main Window** (`main_window.py`): Added city elections tab
- **Task System**: Integrated election notifications

### **4. Testing** (`test_city_elections.py`)
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Full workflow testing
- **Population Simulation**: Threshold trigger testing
- **Candidate Registration**: Electoral process verification
- **Statistics Validation**: System performance metrics

## üöÄ How It Works

### **City Registration Process**
1. **Register City**: Define population estimate and election parameters
2. **Set Thresholds**: Configure 1% initial and 50% expansion triggers
3. **Member Tracking**: Monitor population growth automatically
4. **Election Scheduling**: Automatic election creation when thresholds met

### **Election Workflow**
1. **Threshold Reached**: System detects 1% or 50% population milestone
2. **Election Scheduled**: 30-day campaign period + 7-day voting period
3. **Candidate Registration**: Eligible members register with platforms
4. **Democratic Voting**: Citizens participate in municipal elections
5. **Results Certification**: Winners take office for 1-year terms

### **Term Limit Enforcement**
1. **Eligibility Check**: Automatic verification during candidate registration
2. **Term History**: Complete tracking of previous service
3. **Consecutive Block**: Prevents back-to-back terms
4. **Maximum Limit**: Enforces 4-term lifetime maximum per office

## üéØ Key Benefits

### **Democratic Participation**
- **Population-Scaled**: Representation grows with community size
- **Accessible Entry**: 1% threshold makes elections achievable
- **Broad Representation**: 50% expansion ensures adequate representation

### **Anti-Entrenchment**

- **Public Statistics**: Open access to election data and trends
- **Audit Trail**: Complete verification of democratic processes

### **Scalable System**
- **Multi-City Support**: Handles unlimited cities simultaneously
